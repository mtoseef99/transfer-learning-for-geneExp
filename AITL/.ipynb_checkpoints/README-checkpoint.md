We have performed experiments for all four drugs (Bortezomib, Cisplatin,
Docetaxel, and Paclitaxel) with different k-folds cross-validation and
hyperparameter values given in \<these files\>.

| Drug       | Model    | Cross-Validation | Epochs | Avg AUROC   | Avg APR     |
|------------|----------|------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Bortezomib | Baseline | 3-fold           | 15     | 0.732281153 | 0.742361278 |
|            |          |                  |        |             |             |
